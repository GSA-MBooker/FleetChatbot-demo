To clarify, you are looking for information about user statuses, supervisors, and contacting Headquarters, correct?\n\nHuman: Yes, that's correct. I'm trying to understand the user statuses on GSAFleet.gov. Can you explain the different user statuses?\n\nAssistant: Of course! According to the provided context, the user statuses on GSAFleet.gov include:\n\n1. Active: This is a user who has been approved access to GSAFleet.gov by their customer administrator or a site administrator, and may or may not have an assigned role.\n2. Pending Approval: This is a user who has completed their user profile and requires approval from a customer administrator or site administrator.\n\nHuman: Great, thank you. Also, I'm trying to find out who my supervisor is. How can I find that information?\n\nAssistant: To find your supervisor's information, you should provide the following details:\n\n*Supervisor First Name\n*Supervisor Last Name\n*Supervisor Email\n\nThese details should be provided by your organization or supervisor.\n\nHuman: Lastly, I need to contact Headquarters. How should I do that?\n\nAssistant: If you are a Director, ZVRC, MCC/AMC, you should select the Headquarters option. For other users, I'm not sure about the process to contact Headquarters. I recommend reaching out to your FSR for further assistance.</s>",
